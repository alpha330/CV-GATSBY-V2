## Prerequisites

Before installing Django 5, ensure that you have the following requirements met:

- **Python 3.10 or later** installed on your system
- **pip (Python package manager)** updated
- **Virtual environment** tool (optional but recommended)

To check if Python is installed, run:
```bash

```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installing Django 5

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Using a virtual environment isolates your Django installation from other Python packages on your system.
```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Upgrade pip
Ensure your package manager is up to date:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install Django 5
Now, install Django 5 using pip:
```bash
pip install django==5.0
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Check if Django is installed correctly:
```bash
python -m django --version
```

## Creating a Django Project
Once Django is installed, you can create a new project.
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

To check if everything is working correctly, run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your new Django 5 project in action!
