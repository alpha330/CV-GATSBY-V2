### 2. Type Hinting Support in Views and Models
Django 5 now offers better support for **Type Hinting** in views, models, and forms. This feature improves code readability and helps prevent unexpected errors.

```python
from django.http import HttpRequest, HttpResponse

def my_view(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django 5!")
```

**Advantages:**
- Reduced typing errors
- Better integration with static code analysis tools like MyPy

Django 5 has fully improved support for **Asynchronous Views** and **WebSockets**, allowing developers to build real-time and optimized applications.

#### WebSocket Example:
```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views import View

class AsyncView(View):
    async def get(self, request):
        return JsonResponse({"message": "This is an async response!"})
```
